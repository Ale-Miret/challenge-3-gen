# Challenge 3
## Description
I want to add JavaScript to an online password generatorand I want it to randomly generate a password that is strong, secure, and meetsa certain criteria.

## Usage
*When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, a small window pops up to ask you to set the desired length for your password. If the User chooses a letter instead of a number between 8 and 128, they will see a prompt stating that a number must be selected and send you right back to where you started. 

If the User selects a number between 8-128, they are taken to the next series of questions: lower case, uppser case, number, and special characters selection. 

After selecting your requirements, a password is generated.
